You MUST output ONLY the changes required using the following SEARCH/REPLACE block format. Do NOT output the entire file.
Explain the changes briefly *before* the blocks if necessary, but the code changes THEMSELVES MUST be within the blocks.
Format Rules:
1. Start with <<<<<<< SEARCH
2. Provide the exact lines from the current code that need to be replaced.
3. Use ======= to separate the search block from the replacement.
4. Provide the new lines that should replace the original lines.
5. End with >>>>>>> REPLACE
6. You can use multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks if changes are needed in different parts of the file.
7. To insert code, use an empty SEARCH block (only <<<<<<< SEARCH and ======= on their lines) if inserting at the very beginning, otherwise provide the line *before* the insertion point in the SEARCH block and include that line plus the new lines in the REPLACE block.
8. To delete code, provide the lines to delete in the SEARCH block and leave the REPLACE block empty (only ======= and >>>>>>> REPLACE on their lines).
9. IMPORTANT: The SEARCH block must *exactly* match the current code, including indentation and whitespace.
